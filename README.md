Real Estate Price Prediction Model
Overview

This project builds a machine learning regression pipeline to predict real estate prices based on property characteristics and location-related features. The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end handling of structured tabular data, from preprocessing to model evaluation.

Problem Statement

Accurately estimating property prices is critical for buyers, sellers, and investors. Given historical housing data, this project aims to learn the relationship between property attributes and market value to produce reliable price estimates.

Dataset

Structured tabular real estate data

Features may include:

Location-based attributes

Property size and layout

Construction or age-related features

Target variable: Property price

(Dataset is assumed to be cleaned of identifiers and suitable for supervised learning.)

Methodology

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Feature scaling and normalization

Train-test split

Feature Engineering

Selection of relevant predictors

Removal of redundant or noisy features

Modeling

Regression-based machine learning models

Model training and hyperparameter tuning

Evaluation

Performance measured using regression metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score

Results

The trained model demonstrates the ability to capture key pricing patterns in real estate data, producing reasonable estimates within acceptable error bounds for a baseline predictive system.
