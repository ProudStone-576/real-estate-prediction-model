## Real Estate Price Prediction Model
# Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to predict real estate property prices based on structured housing data.
The goal is to demonstrate a complete end-to-end regression workflow: data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

# Problem Statement

Accurately estimating property prices is a common real-world problem in real estate, finance, and urban analytics.
Given historical property data (location, size, and other attributes), the model learns patterns that influence market value.

# Dataset

Structured tabular dataset containing property features

Target variable: property price

Includes numerical and categorical attributes

(Dataset source can be replaced or extended without changing the pipeline.)

# Approach

Data Cleaning

Handling missing values

Removing inconsistent or invalid entries

Feature Engineering

Encoding categorical variables

Scaling numerical features

# Modeling

Applied regression algorithms using scikit-learn

Trained and validated models on historical data

# Evaluation

Performance measured using regression metrics (e.g. RMSE, R²)

Compared predictions against actual prices

Technologies Used

* Python

* Pandas

* NumPy

* Scikit-learn

* Jupyter Notebook

# Results

The model demonstrates the ability to learn meaningful relationships between property features and prices, achieving reasonable predictive performance on unseen data.
